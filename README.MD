My attempted solutions for the Daily Coding Problem (DCP) from www.dailycodingproblem.com

Each folder will have a problem solution file and an output file with a number x in the filename. For example dcp_1.cpp and dcp_1.out, where x =1.</br>
NOTE : I am using MSYS2 to have a linux like environment in windows.</br>
You may not have that directly installed.
```
$ ls
dcp_x.cpp
$ g++ dcp_x.cpp -o dcp_x.exe
$ ls
dcp_x.cpp  dcp_x.exe
$ ls dcp_x.exe > dcp_x.out
$ ls
dcp_x.cpp dcp_x.exe dcp_x.out
```

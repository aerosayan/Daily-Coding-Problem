My attempted solutions for the Daily Coding Problem (DCP) from www.dailycodingproblem.com

Each folder will have a problem solution file and an output file with a number x in the filename. For example dcp_30.py and dcp_30_output.txt, where x =30.
```
$ ls
dcp_x.py              # the solution file
dcp_x_output.txt      # the stored output file

```
